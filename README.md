##Python Terminal Text Generator

Very very simple python script that creates an ASCII text in the console

In celebration of Feral's release of Shadow of Mordor, I've created a new Feral Games ASCII art and script.

# Update on plans
I'm now working to integrate this with a separate ASCII python library in order to generate sustainable terminal ASCII-art. This will convert text input to ASCII art in a selection of fonts, and can be saved to the system to be called later. Users will be able to create commands under a name of their choice ("pcmr-ascii" or "feral") to display their ASCII art in the terminal.
