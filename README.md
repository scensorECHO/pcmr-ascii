# pcmr-ascii
Very very simple python script that creates an ASCII text in the console

In celebration of Feral's release of Shadow of Mordor, I've created a new Feral Games ASCII art and script.

Also first /r/linux_gaming member to message me will get a gifted Shadow of Mordor copy. Won't be until tonight, roughly 7PM CST.
